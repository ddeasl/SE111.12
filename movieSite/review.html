                <p><b>Tom Ford</b> <i>12/30/04</i></p>
                <p>I saw this in the cinema and loved it. Essentially a one-man-band show from Hanks who proves himself
                    up to the challenge with an intense physical performance. Great scenery and the addition of 'Wilson'
                    is the icing on the cake.</p>
                <p>So much has been written about the performance of Tom Hanks. He is so convincing that for a while I
                    actually thought this had happened to him. This is a story of loneliness. The Robinson Crusoe aspect
                    is slowly developed as Hanks employs what knowledge he has to do the rudimentary things that are
                    required to survive. Crusoe has Friday; Hanks has Wilson. The despair that develops as one begins to
                    realize that he may die, never seeing another human being or experiencing some tenderness, is so
                    disturbing. When Hanks walks around, arms in the air, announcing to the world that he has made fire,
                    it's a primitive conquest that seems so grand yet so minuscule. The final scene in the film is so
                    gut wrenching. No man is an island but a part of a greater universe. I'm not speaking from a
                    religious foundation but that which is within us.</p>
                <p>I have to admit my summary line would have worked even better if it wasn't Tom Hanks but Tom Cruise
                    in the main role here ... that funny anecdote aside, the movie is quite the tour de force. But as
                    every good story you'll have to wait until the island story begins. When it begins though, there is
                    quite the hard story to go through.</p>
                <p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Actual lines of dialogue were written for Wilson the volleyball, to help Tom Hanks have a more
                        natural interaction with the inanimate object.</li>
                    <li>Job applications for FedEx went up by 30% after the release of this film.</li>
                    <li>Most of the nighttime scenes on the island (except the creation of fire scene) were shot during
                        the daytime. The darkness and night sky effects were added in post-production.</li>
                </ul>
